## Installation

```bash
cd MCP/meal-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

The server connects to the Nutrifit GraphQL backend at `http://localhost:8080/graphql` by default.

To use a different endpoint, set the `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```bash
export GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://your-backend.com/graphql
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutrifit-meal": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/Nutrifit-mobile/MCP/meal-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflows

### Analyze a meal photo
```
User: "I just ate this meal [photo]"
Claude uses: analyze_meal_photo
→ Returns detected foods with nutrition
Claude: "I detected: chicken breast (150g, 250 kcal), rice (100g, 130 kcal)..."

User: "Confirm the chicken and rice"
Claude uses: confirm_meal_analysis
→ Meal saved permanently
```

### Daily nutrition check
```
User: "How many calories did I eat today?"
Claude uses: get_daily_summary
→ Returns total calories, macros, meal count
Claude: "Today you've had 1,850 kcal from 3 meals..."
```

### Weekly report
```
User: "Show me my nutrition for this week"
Claude uses: get_summary_range (groupBy: DAY)
→ Returns 7 days of data + totals
Claude: "This week: 12,450 kcal total, avg 1,779 kcal/day..."
```
