"""Integration tests for OpenFoodFacts client with real API.

Tests P3.7.3: OpenFoodFacts integration with real public API calls.

These tests are opt-in but don't require API keys (public API).
Run with: pytest -m integration_real

These tests verify:
- Barcode lookup with real OpenFoodFacts database
- Nutrient extraction from product data
- Circuit breaker behavior
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Metadata extraction (name, brand, category, image_url)
- Fallback strategies (energy kJ→kcal, salt→sodium)
